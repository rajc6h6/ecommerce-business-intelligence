# 🛍️ E-Commerce Business Intelligence Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This is a realistic business intelligence project built to uncover key insights for an online store using multi-table e-commerce data. The goal was to simulate work a freelance data analyst might do for a real client — from raw CSV files to a polished report full of visual insights.

The entire analysis was performed using **Python**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib** — with special attention to data cleaning, merging, and insight generation.

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The original dataset is available at:  
[Kaggle E-Commerce Dataset Link](https://www.kaggle.com/...)


This dataset simulates a real e-commerce business and includes:

- `customers.csv` — Customer locations
- `orders.csv` — Order IDs, timestamps, status
- `order_items.csv` — Products ordered per order
- `products.csv` — Product category, dimensions
- `payments.csv` — Type and amount of payments
- `reviews.csv` — Ratings and comments
- `returns.csv` — Returned order details

Each file had different structures and issues, so a significant part of this project involved handling missing values, correcting datatypes, and merging datasets.

The data used in this project was first cleaned and transformed into SQL-ready tables (fact/dim format) using a separate notebook. This simulates how a professional analyst prepares data before analysis.

## 📌 Business Insights & Recommendations

- **No Repeat Buyers**: Currently, all customers purchase only once. Consider strategies like follow-up emails, loyalty discounts, or post-purchase engagement to improve retention.
  
- **Top Products Drive Most Sales**: A small subset of products drives a large chunk of revenue. Optimize ad spending and stock management around these items.

- **High Return Rate in Some Categories**: Categories with frequent returns might need better product descriptions, images, or shipping protection.

- **Credit Cards Dominate Payment Method**: Ensure fast and secure experience for credit card users, as most customers prefer this method.
